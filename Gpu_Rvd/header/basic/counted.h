	 * a Counted object must call ref() on this object and call unref()
	 * when they no longer need it. The object is destroyed when no more
	 * objects hold a reference on it( when the last holder calls unref()).
	 *
	 * Objects can benefit reference counted sharing simply by deriving 
	 * from Counted and implementing the virtual destructor.
	 *
	 * Reference acquisition and release can be done manually by explicitly
	 * calling ref() and unref() on the reference counted objects, or can be
	 * doen automatically by using SmartPointer<T>
