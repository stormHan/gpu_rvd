	 * SmartPointer has the ability of taking ownership of a pointer of
	 * type\p T and shares that ownership:once they take ownership, the group
     * of owners of a pointer become responsible for its deletion when the
     * last one of them releases that ownership.
     *
     * The object pointed to must implement the two following static
     * functions:
     * - T::ref(T*): to increment the reference count
     * - T::unref(T*): to decrement the reference count.
     *
     * More specifically, SmartPointer can be used with classes inheriting the
     * Counted class.
